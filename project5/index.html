    My name is Charlotte Steinberg. I am currently studying at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications studying Broadcast and Digital Journalism. I am interested in working in the sports side of Broadcasting. I have great communication, teamwork, and writing skills. I currently work for the New York Post as a Sports Social Media Intern as well as Syracuse Athletics as a creative and social media intern. I love to try new restaurants and I transferred to Syracuse after my freshman year at Michigan State University. I have one brother and one sister, and my mom moved to America at the age of 18! I am huge NBA fan and I love to play basketball.
