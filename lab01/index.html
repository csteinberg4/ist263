    <p>	In the State of New York, hate crimes are a crucial problem in the community, and anyone in leadership has yet to find a solution to combat it. In 2019 alone, there were 750 reported hate crimes against Jewish people. The second-biggest reported group in 2019 that had crimes committed against them were anti-Asian crimes, with 238. </p> 

	<p> When people first think of the phrase “hate crimes,” they don’t always think of a particular group. According to CNN, hate crimes in New York are up 76% in New York City compared to 2022. In the visualization below, New York is the leading county with 617 reported hate crimes, and these numbers come from the New York State government and the New York Police Department Hate Crimes Task Force (HCTF). </p>

	<iframe title="Which County Had the Most Hate Crimes Occur?" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-SqQf9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SqQf9/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="523" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

	<p>The HCTF data showed Asian hate crimes were down 32%, and black hate crimes have doubled. Now you might be asking yourself how severe are these hate crimes. How about a teenager on the Upper West Side of Manhattan being accused of threatening six Jewish boys with swords? <a href= "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/us/hate-crimes-rise-in-new-york-city?"> Point proven. </a> </p>

	<p> To better understand the environment of hate crimes in the younger generation, I spoke to Winnick Hillel Center for Jewish Life’s President Sydney Schroeder. Schroeder, who is from California, has served on Hillel’s leadership board for the past two years and understands the reality that Jewish students face on a daily basis. </p>

	<p>“It is extremely disheartening to see that hate crimes are still prevalent in our country, although it is a reality we still face,” said Schroeder. “To me, it shows that anti-semitism is alive and well, which is terrifying. I believe that how we combat this is to continue learning about these acts and advocate for our own community as well as other minorities if we see something.” </p>

	<p> Education is the main factor in improving the lives of each and every group of people. Whether they are Jewish, Asian, black, or any other ethnicity, everyone deserves to be treated the same way. Anti-semitism, as Schroeder pointed out, is something that people have to look past in their everday life and have not to live their life in fear. </p>

	<p> On the topic of education, Rabbi Ethan Bair, who is Syracuse’s campus rabbi and currently works for the Winnick Hillel Center for Jewish Life, is also something he stressed when it comes to being better for the future. According to the Rabbi, he is very concerned about the recent uptick in hate crimes in New York City. </p>

	<p>“It is very dishearting to learn that that’s the case … I think that anti-semtism seems like it is on the rise; unfortunately, people look for scapegoats when they have issues, whether it’s issues during the pandemic or any other issues. I think education is very important.” </p>

	<p>The rabbi says the best way to combat hate crimes is to surround yourself with different people from different cultures. People who are different than each other can always learn something new from each other. </p>

	<p>As campus rabbi, Ethan Bair wants to support students in a positive identity and affiliations such as activities with Judaism. He wants to focus on the positive side and for Jewish students not to combat hate but be able to be knowledgeable and share wisdom with the world. </p>

	<p>How can we do better in the future? Nobody has a crystal ball, but with the recent activity on social media by famous celebrities such as Kanye West, hate crimes do not seem to be slowing down. Some people might not even know they are committing a hate crime but commit it due to outside influences. Whether that is friends or family advising what is right and wrong, it really starts in the home. </p>

	<p>Michael Steinberg, a lawyer who has grown up his entire life on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and recognizes himself as a Jewish person, thinks political figures can also influence hate crimes. When I spoke to the lawyer, he was not afraid to let his emotion come through, as he seemed to be very passionate about how frustrated he was. </p>

	<p>“We had a leader Trump who gave voice to racism which legitimized hate groups. When people are angry and frustrated with their lives, they need enemies to cast blame,” said the New York Law School graduate, “Hate mongers are failed in life and need scapegoats. They are sick and have ugly personal lives”. </p>

	<p>In NYPD data, this past November, antisemitic hate crimes rose 125%, according to ABC 7’s Eyewitness News. Racism has been a big concern of Mayor Eric Adams, and he has yet to find a way to combat it fully. Until more education is implemented and leaders of the United States take the correct steps, hate crimes will continue to be a problem, and more people will not feel accepted in our <a href= "https://abc7ny.com/nyc-hate-crimes-antisemitic-nypd/12528309/"> country. </a> </p>
